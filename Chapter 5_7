//chap5.7: Design a structure called car that holds the following information
//about an automobile: its make, as a string in a character array
//or in a string object, and the year it was built, as an integer.
//Write a program that asks the user how many cars to catalog.
//The program should then use new to create a dynamic array of
//that many car structures. Next, it should prompt the user to
//input the make (which might consist of more than one word)
//and year information for each structure. Note that this
//requires some care because it alternates reading strings
//with numeric data (see Chapter 4). Finally, it should display
//the contents of each structure. A sample run should look
//something like the following:

//How many cars do you wish to catalog? 2
//Car #1:
//Please enter the make: Hudson Hornet
//Please enter the year made: 1952
//Car #2: Please enter the make: Kaiser
//Please enter the year made: 1951
//Here is your collection:
//1952 Hudson Hornet
//1951 Kaiser

{
    std::string carname;
    int yearBuilt;

    int counter = 0; // when not initialized with a value the system will
                    //assign random numbers

    std::cin >> catalog;

    CarInfo* data = new CarInfo [catalog];

        std::cout << "Car #" << i + 1 << ":\n";
