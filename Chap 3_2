/*chap 3.2: Write a short program that asks for your height in feet and inches and your weight in pounds.
//(Use three variables to store the information.) Have the program report your BMI (Body Mass Index).
//To calculate the BMI, first convert your height in feet and inches to your height in inches. Then, convert
//your height in inches to your height in meters by multiplying by 0.0254. Then, converts your weight in pounds into
//your mass in kilograms by dividing  by 2.2. Finally, compute your BMI by dividing your mass in kilograms by the square
//of your height in meters. Use symbolic constants to represent the various conversion factors.
