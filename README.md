1. Write a C++ program that dsiplays your name and address.

2. Write a C++ program that asks for a distance in furlongs and converts it to yards(one furlong is 220 yards).

3. Write a C++ program that uses three user-defined functions (counting main() as one) and produces the following output:
  Three blind mice
  Three blind mice
  See how they run
  See how they run

  One function, called two times, should produce the first two lines, and the remaining function, also called twice,     should produce the remaining output.

4. Wrtie a program that has main() call a user-defined function that takes a Celsius temperature value as an argument and then returns the equivalent Fahrenheit value. The program should request the Celsius value as input from the user and display the result, as shown in the following code:

  Please enter a Celsius value: 20
  20 degrees Celsius is 68 degrees Fahrenheit.

  For reference, here is the formula for making the conversion:

  Fahrenheit = 1.8 X celsius + 32.0
