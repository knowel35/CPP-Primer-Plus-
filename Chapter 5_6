//chap 5.6: You sell the book C++ for Fools. Write a program that has you enter a year's worth of
//monthly sales (in terms of number of books, not of money). The program should use a
//loop to prompt you by month, using an array of char * (or an array of string objects, if
//you prefer) initialized to the month strings and storing the input data in an array of int.
//Then, the program should find the sum of the array contents and report the total sales
//for the year.
