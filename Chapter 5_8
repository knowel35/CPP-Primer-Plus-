//chap5.8: Write a program that uses an array of char and a loop to read one word at a time
//until the word done is entered. The program should then report the number of
//words entered (not counting done). A sample run could look like this:

//Enter words (to stop, type the word done):
//anteater birthday category dumpster
//envy finagle geometry done for sure
//You entered a total of 7 words.

//You should include the cstring header file and use the strcmp() function to
//make the comparison test.

#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>

const int Arsize = 100;

int main()
{

    char word[Arsize];
    int counter = 0;


    std::cout << "Enter words (to stop, type the word done): \n";

    do
    {
        counter++;
        std::cin >> word;
    }
    while (strcmp(word, "done"));

    std::cout << "You entered a total of " << counter - 1 << " words.\n";

    return 0;
}
