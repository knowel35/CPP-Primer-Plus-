//chap2.6: Write a program that has main() call a user-defined function that takes a distance
//in light years as an argument and then returns the distance in astronomical units.
//The program should request the light year value as input from the user and display
//the result, as shown in the following code:

//Enter the number of light years: 4.2
//4.2 light years = 265608 astronomical units

//An Astronomical units is the average distance from the earth to the sun(about
//150,000,000 km or 93,000,000 miles), and a light year is the distance light travels in
//a year (about 10 trillion kilometers or 6 trillion miles). (The nearest star after the
//sun is about 4.2 light years away.) Use type double (as in Listing 2.4 and this conversion
//factor:

//1 light years = 63,240 astronomical units

#include <iostream>

const long double Distance(double l);

int main(void)
{
    double lightYrs;

    std::cout << "Enter the number of light years: ";
    std::cin >> lightYrs;

    long double astroUnit = Distance(lightYrs);

    std::cout << lightYrs << " years = " << astroUnit << " astronomical units.\n";

    return 0;
}

const long double Distance(double l)
{
    long double temp = l * 63240;

    return temp;
