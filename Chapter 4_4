//chap4.4: Write a program that asks the user to enter his or her first name and the last
//name, and that then constructs, stores, and displays a third string, consisting of the
//user's last name followed by a comma, a space, and first name. User string objects
//and methods from the string header file. A simple run could look like this:

//Enter your first name: Flip
//Enter your last name: Fleming
//Here's the information in a single string: Fleming,Flip

#include <iostream>
#include <string.h>
