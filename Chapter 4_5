//chap 4.5: The CandyBar structure contains three members. The first member holds the brand
//name of a candy bar. The second member holds the weight (which may have a fractional part)
//of the candy bar, and the third member holds the number of calories (an integer value)
//in the cady bar. Write a program that declares such a structure and creates a CandyBar
//variable called snack, initializing its members to "Mocha Munch". 2.3 and 350, respectively.
//The initialization should be part of the declaration for snack. Finally, the program should
//display the contents of the snack variable.
